				<h3>by: David E. Rose</h3>

			<p>My story starts at ten years old in 1992.  My father had started his own business 
			“DR. Computers” (David = “me” plus Roy = “my dad”... clever huh? ).  We bought parts ourselves, 
			built computers and sold them for profit. (you could do that in the 90's)  Dad taught me how and 
			I was surprised to learn that it really wasn't that hard and it came easy for me.  
			In those days Dad had me put together 386's/486's and even the original Pentiums with a 
			whopping 4 megabytes of ram.  I've built my own computers ever since.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://www.borgia.com/">High School</a> I developed a passion for art, and I was 
			thoroughly addicted to computer games. I thought I would smash the two things together and become 
			a video game developer.  How hard could it be anyways?</p>

			<p>Freshly graduated and ready to take on the world I enrolled in my first semester at a local 
			community college and took my first ever programming course in Visual Basic(I think).  To be honest, 
			I don't really remember much about the class at all other than not liking it and barely passing it.  
			I became discouraged about becoming a programmer, so instead I decided to focus on the art side 
			of game design. </p>

			<h3>"The world is my oyster!.. or something like that."</h3>

			<p><a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/schaumburg">Art School</a> was a blast.  I had so much fun 
			making things and I didn't really think too much about how hard getting a job was really going to be.  
			I did hand drawn animation.  2D flash animation and 3D animation in 3D Studio Max and Zbrush.  I seemed 
			especially good at visual effects and particle systems so I decided to focus on making fire, explosions 
			and anything else that I thought was cool.  It was good times!</p>

			<h3>"Leave me alone I'm busy thinking brilliant thoughts..."</h3>

			<p>Then after graduating in 2005, the reality sunk in that everyone and their cat also wanted to make 
			video games for a living so the competition was fierce.  Also, it was almost guaranteed that I would 
			have to move out west if I was serious.  I told myself it was worth it and I worked hard at training 
			myself even after school.  After a year of additional training and a summer internship I finally got 
			the call I had been waiting for a position with a real video game developer for a VFX artist in Seattle!  
			I passed the phone interview and they offered to fly me out for an in person interview.  This was it!!! </p>

			<h3>"Wait... so there are others that wanted to make video games too?"</h3>

			<p>Then the day finally came... interview day and was it ever grueling!  The interview lasted 8 hours 
			with an hour lunch... a full work day.  I met with the entire company handfuls at a time.  Things looked 
			great for the first half, through lunch but then something happened in the second half that threw me off 
			guard.   One of the employees asked me if I would be comfortable creating “adult content” and she was 
			careful to point out that she wasn't talking about the blood and guts kind of adult content.  I had never 
			thought about this before and I didn't know how to answer the question.  My reaction however was all the 
			answer they needed.  I really wasn't comfortable and after that question the energy in the room changed 
			for the rest of the interview.  </p>

			<h3>"This isn't going to end well is it?"</h3>

			<p>On the flight home I had a sinking feeling in my stomach that my dreams were dying.  Then  two weeks 
			later I received my “Dear John” letter in the mail thanking me for the interest but the company decided 
			I was not a good fit for the position.  After all the hard work, I put in I was still getting nowhere and 
			I began to question if this was what I REALLY wanted to do.  Did I really want to spend my life struggling 
			to get hired on for a project that could potentially be morally questionable?  Not really... I wanted to 
			build something to inspire. </p>

			<p>As I tried to figure out what I wanted to do in the long run, I knew I needed a big boy job in the short 
			term so I started doing tech support.  Nothing glamorous, but it paid the bills...  After a few years of 
			doing it however, I really wanted to find something more fulfilling.</p>

			<h3>"Wait you did reboot? Now what?"</h3>

			<p>Then, my life took a turn that I never saw coming.  In my search for purpose, I ended up looking for 
			cosmic purpose and came to the conclusion that either A: there was none or B: maybe there was a God and 
			"he" had a purpose for me.  I wasn't thrilled with the idea of A, so I thought I would at least test out 
			B before concluding that A was the only answer that I could find.  So one day when I was particularly 
			desperate,  I decided to try praying to this “God” whoever "he" was.  I said “God I don't know if you're 
			real or not... but if you are... tell me what to do because I'm kind of lost down here...” To my shock, 
			I got an answer... a vision... to share the gospel with people who were in search of hope and a 
			purpose like me.</p>

			<h3>"Hello? Is it me you're looking for?"</h3>

			<p>What did this mean?  What was I supposed to do quit my job and go back to school to become a pastor?  
			I wasn't sure but I did it anyway... I quit my job, enrolled in seminary and was determined to learn more 
			about this God and what exactly he wanted from me.  <a href="https://asburyseminary.edu/">Seminary</a> was 
			hard, I struggled with the work, but I eventually got through it and graduated in December of 2013.  </p>

			<h3>"It was tough, but I did it!"</h3>

			<p>But towards the end of seminary I began to question whether or not I was really supposed to be a pastor 
			or if I was the right kind of personality for it.  I've always been introverted and independent.  
			I thought maybe I was supposed to use my skills in graphics and video to “preach” instead of behind a 
			physical pulpit.  But some opportunities came to try out pastoring a church part time and I decided 
			the best way to find out was to give it a real try.  At that time I also took on a job with another large 
			church as a video and media producer.  I thought this way I could have my hand in both sides and one of 
			them would eventually win out.  </p>

			<h3>"Welcome one and all!  Let's change the world!"</h3>

			<p>After a few years, an opportunity came up to pastor in a Full-time setting.  Doing it part time wasn't 
			so bad so I thought I would make a go of it but I would have to quit the media job.  I had no idea though 
			that I wasn't prepared at all for the difference in expectation.  After two years of doing pastoral ministry 
			in a Full Time setting I once again found myself struggling with what I was doing.  I enjoyed preaching 
			every week, but I struggled with many other aspects of the job.  The church and congregation were very 
			“traditional” and I never could find a good use for my skills in tech and media and I missed using them 
			dearly.  I eventually came to the conclusion that I chose the wrong path once again, but knowing how 
			competitive graphic and media jobs were I felt like it was going to be the gaming industry all over again.  
			Now what was I going to do?</p>

			<p>My wife's sister was a programmer, told me how in-demand she is and said I really should give it a shot.  
			She mentioned a St. Louis program called <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">Launch Code</a> that some of 
			her friends got hired from.  I was nervous about programming given my first foray right out of high school 
			but I gave it a try once again.  </p>

			<p>This time... I loved it!  I started with HTML, then CSS then some JavaScript.  I enrolled in LC101 and 
			got accepted and learned Python and I am loving every moment of it.  Perhaps I just wasn't ready the first 
			time around because now I can't seem to get enough of coding!</p>

			<h3>"Coding is fun this time! Who knew?"</h3>

			<p>That brings me to the present where it seems as if my story is coming full circle.  This time I have a 
			desire to merge my love of tech with my love of Christ and use it to build something beautiful.  My goal 
			before I die is to leave the world in just a little better shape than it was when I got here.  I believe 
			love is the answer.  I believe Jesus is the example and the path towards redefining what love is and how 
			it can transform our world.  Love without strings, love without judgment.  How will love and coding come 
			together?  I don't know but I am really excited to find out!</p>
